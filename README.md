## How To Use:
We'll call the device to take the data from as the 'source device'. And the device you want to receive the data in as the 'receiving device'.
[⭐- Required; ➕- Optional; ⚠️- Known Problems]

### ⭐Setup (Only need to be done the first time app runs after installing):
- To unlock the functionality of the app, press the ellipsis (three horizontal dots) in the top-left corner, then press "Settings".
- Read the Disclaimer and Warning, then press the checkbox below it to confirm you understand the use-case of the app.
- Now, press back button in the top left corner, then press the ellipsis again and press "Configure Details".
- Write your device name (this will be used to identify if its the host or as we say 'source device').
- Enter a port, remember that the port should be same on the 'source device' and 'receiving device' to ensure you are on the same subnet to allow file transfer and 'source device' discovery.

### ⭐To Send Files to a Device:
- Open the app on the 'source device', and press the ellipsis (three horizontal dots) in the top-left corner, then press "Device Storage".
- Now, find your files or whole folders, then hold them to see a menu and press "Map To Network" (this moves the file/folder(s) to shared location so do this carefully; *`Release v1.0.0 has no protection for this.`*).
- Press the back button in the top left corner, and press **Start Service** button, thats all for the 'source device'. [Proceed to "To Receive Files from a Device" section]

### ⭐To Receive Files from a Device:
- Open the app on the 'receiving device', tap the ellipsis (three horizontal dots) in the top-left corner, and press **Search Hosts**.
- Now press the blue button saying "Auto Scan" then you can see the server's name in a box, hold the box and press "Get Access Point".
- Press the back button in the top left corner, then press the ellipsis (three horizontal dots) in the top-left corner, then press "Device Storage".
- In the top-right corner press the three horizontal bars, then again press the server's name in the menu that appeared.
- Now, you're navigating the 'source device' shared files/folders.
- Hold on any file (transferring whole folders isn't supported yet) and press "Download File" and then the files will be transferred top your phone in the "storage/emulated/0/.LFTUC-Shared/LFTUC-Received".

### ➕Preferred Apps (Optional):
- Best advised to use 'Zarchiver' or any other file manager if you're comfortable.

### ⚠️"Device Storage" not showing files/folders in my device:
- This issue occurs in some OEM devices (eg. IQOO Z9x5), still works on most of the devices like Vivo, Motorola, etc.
- More Devices will be tested soon. If it works on your device, you could send the make and model or just OEM's name in the "Rate The App/ Feedback" for helping in the process.
